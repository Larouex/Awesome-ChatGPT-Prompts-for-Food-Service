# Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP) for Larouex Gourmet Foods

## 1. Conduct a Hazard Analysis

Three types of hazards may occur during the production of smoked beef brisket: biological, chemical, and physical.

Biological hazards include bacteria like E.coli, Salmonella, and Listeria that can grow on raw meat. This hazard can be controlled through proper refrigeration, cooking to the appropriate internal temperature, and avoiding cross-contamination.

Chemical hazards could occur if cleaning agents or other chemicals come into contact with the meat or the equipment used for smoking. This can be mitigated by correctly storing and using such substances away from food preparation areas.

Physical hazards might include foreign bodies like metal shards from broken equipment, glass, or plastic. These can be controlled through proper maintenance and inspection of equipment, and through good manufacturing practices.

## 2. Determine the Critical Control Points (CCPs)

CCPs for smoked beef brisket are:

- Refrigeration: Proper refrigeration prevents bacterial growth.
- Cooking: The brisket must reach a sufficient internal temperature to kill bacteria.
- Smoking: Improper smoking can lead to the formation of harmful substances.
- Cooling and storage: Correct cooling and storage is necessary to prevent bacterial growth post-cooking.

## 3. Establish Critical Limits

- Refrigeration: The temperature of the refrigeration units should not exceed 40°F (4°C).
- Cooking: The internal temperature of the brisket should reach at least 165°F (74°C) during the initial smoking and 203°F (95°C) during the final smoking.
- Smoking: Maintain a consistent temperature of 225°F (107°C) during smoking.
- Cooling and storage: Cool at room temperature for 30-45 minutes. Refrigerated storage temperature should be below 40°F (4°C). The freezer storage temperature should be 0°F (-18°C) or lower.

## 4. Establish Monitoring Procedures

- Refrigeration: Check and log the temperature of the refrigerator every four hours.
- Cooking: Use a probe thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of the brisket during smoking.
- Smoking: Regularly check and maintain the temperature of the smoker.
- Cooling and storage: Monitor room temperature during cooling, and check refrigerator and freezer temperatures regularly.

## 5. Establish Corrective Actions

If any critical limit is not met, the following corrective actions should be taken:

- Refrigeration: If the refrigerator temperature exceeds 40°F (4°C), adjust the refrigerator temperature or move the brisket to a properly functioning unit.
- Cooking: If the brisket does not reach the necessary internal temperature, continue cooking until it does.
- Smoking: If the smoker is not maintaining the correct temperature, adjust it as necessary.
- Cooling and storage: If the storage temperatures are not appropriate, adjust the refrigerator or freezer settings, or move the product to a properly functioning unit.

## 6. Establish Verification Procedures

- Regularly calibrate thermometers used for monitoring.
- Routinely inspect equipment for cleanliness and functionality.
- Perform random sampling and microbiological testing of the product.
- Review monitoring records weekly to confirm procedures are being followed.

## 7. Establish Record Keeping and Documentation Procedures

Keep a daily log of all temperatures (refrigerator, smoker, and internal meat temperature), inspection results, and corrective actions taken. All logs should be kept for a minimum of one year.
