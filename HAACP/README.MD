The product will be smoked beef brisket and the detailed recipe is as follows…
I. Preparation Steps

1. Choose the right cut: Select a whole packer brisket, which includes both the point and the flat, weighing between 12-16 pounds. Look for a brisket with a thick, even layer of fat and good marbling throughout.
2. Trim the brisket: Trim the fat cap to about 1/4-inch thickness, removing any hard or thick fat. Trim any silver skin or excess fat from the meat side.
3. Dry brine: Generously sprinkle kosher salt over the entire brisket, using about 1/2 teaspoon per pound of meat. Wrap the brisket tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 48 hours.
   II. Seasonings
4. Prepare the dry rub: Combine the following ingredients in a bowl:
   o 1/4 cup black pepper, coarsely ground
   o 1/4 cup smoked paprika
   o 2 tablespoons brown sugar
   o 2 tablespoons granulated garlic
   o 2 tablespoons granulated onion
   o 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (optional, adjust to taste)
5. Apply the dry rub: Remove the brisket from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Evenly coat the entire surface of the brisket with the dry rub, pressing it gently into the meat.
   III. Smoking Procedure
6. Preheat the smoker: Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C) using a mixture of fruitwood (like apple or cherry) and hardwood (like oak or hickory).
7. Smoke the brisket: Place the brisket fat-side up in the smoker. Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the brisket to monitor internal temperature. Smoke until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C), approximately 8-12 hours, depending on the size of the brisket.
8. Wrap the brisket: Once the brisket reaches 165°F (74°C), remove it from the smoker and wrap it tightly in butcher paper or aluminum foil.
9. Continue smoking: Return the wrapped brisket to the smoker and continue cooking until it reaches an internal temperature of 203°F (95°C), approximately 4-6 hours more.
10. Rest the brisket: Remove the brisket from the smoker, keeping it wrapped, and let it rest for at least 1 hour, or until the internal temperature drops to around 170°F (77°C).
    IV. Cooling
11. Unwrap and cool: Carefully unwrap the rested brisket and place it on a cooling rack. Allow the brisket to cool at room temperature for 30-45 minutes.
    V. Vacuum Sealing
12. Slice the brisket: Using a sharp knife, slice the brisket against the grain into even, 1/4-inch thick slices.
13. Vacuum seal: Separate the sliced brisket into desired portions. Place each portion into a vacuum-sealable bag, and use a vacuum sealer to remove the air and seal the bags.
    VI. Storage
14. Refrigerate or freeze: Store vacuum-sealed bags of sliced brisket in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. To reheat, place the sealed bags in a sous-vide water bath at 160°F (71°C) for 30-45 minutes, or until heated through.
